# Tagalog-Correction-Tool
This application will serve as a grammar checker correcting common Filipino grammatical mistakes such as din/rin, daw/raw, and doon/roon to name a few.

## Instructions
To run LanguageTool with the custom Tagalog language, place the <b>grammar.xml</b> into the <code>\rules\tl</code> folder and the <b>tagalog.dict</b> dictionary into the <code>\resource\tl</code> folder. The <b>tagset.txt</b> is used as a guide for POS tags.
